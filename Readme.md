## This is an export of the content that we use in the app Umbrella

You can download Umbrella on [Github](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.umbrella), [Amazon] (https://www.amazon.com/Security-First-Umbrella-made-easy/dp/B01AKN9M1Y) or our [F-Droid Repo] (https://secfirst.org/fdroid/repo) (F-Droid Fingerprint: 39EB57052F8D684514176819D1645F6A0A7BD943DBC31AB101949006AC0BC228) 

Currently the only encoding in the app is .JSON files and the language is only English, but we hope this becomes a basis for translation to other languages. 

If you are looking for slightly eaiser to use formats, we have also made the original content documents available in Word [.doc] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/doc/en), and Markdown [.md] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/doc/en).

We are currently translating Umbrella into other languages. You can see our progress and volunteer to translate on our [Transifex] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content). Many thanks to the awesome team at the [Localization Lab] (http://www.localizationlab.org) for helping us conduct such as massive undertaking!

This is the first export of Umbrella so there may be issues and inaccuracies, please report them to [info@secfirst.org](info@secfirst.org)

We are currently in the middle of making our content flow more efficient and are collaborating with a community project to make it easier to reuse. For more details on that, see [here] (https://iilab.github.io/contentascode/).
