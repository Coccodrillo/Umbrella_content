For many people activists, journalists or aid workers, meetings can be
high-risk encounters. Meetings can expose the identity or work of either
you or the person you meet with, and have often been the scene of
arrests. For this reason, it is vital to put the highest level of
planning and preparation into meetings involving vulnerable human rights
defenders or whistleblowers.

You should choose the area you plan to meet in carefully. It should be
an area the person you are meeting (and you if possible) is comfortable
in and knows well. If you don?t know it ? get to know it. You should be
able to plan out your approach, possible escape and nearby safe spots
such as partners, supportive local population, and embassies.

Once you have chosen the area, you need to choose the specific meeting
location. Often the most obvious locations such as their office/home
offer a false sense of security and you can be more likely to be under
surveillance there. It may be better to meet in a public place such as a
café. In choosing a café, be careful of the usual spots that human
rights defenders frequent ? Perhaps adversaries are aware of this this
too. Try to choose a location not frequented by people likely to be
targeted by surveillance. If you don?t know a location and will not get
a chance to see it before you arrive, use the internet to try and view
pictures and gather information about it.

Think about various aspects that may allow you to fit in:

-   Who are the clientele who use it?
-   What do they wear?
-   What size groups do they sit in?
-   Are the tables so close to each other that you can be easily
    overheard?
-   Is it likely to be crowded?
-   Would you look suspicious entering there?

Try to check if there?s there a place to sit where you can observe the
whole location but still have your back to a wall and be close to / have
a clear path to an escape route. You should always have an alternative
backup meeting place nearby and if you feel there is a risk of
surveillance or problems at your first choice location ? be ready to
switch to it at the very last minute.

There are a few scenarios you should play out in your head before you go
to your meeting. Some may not put you at any extra risk but it?s useful
to have thought them through in advance.

-   Will you or they have to travel through checkpoints? If so what is
    your story?
-   What will you do if are delayed?
-   What if the person is early /late/ arrives unexpectedly with a third
    party who you don?t know or trust?
-   What is your contact plan for if the person doesn?t show at all?
-   What if the person is temporarily insecure ? someone else is talking
    to them, they have been stopped by authorities/ recognised/ are
    drawing attention to themselves?
-   How much information you are going to give the person you are
    meeting?
-   What if they pass you something (documents/USB etc.)? Where will you
    put it to keep it out of sight?
-   What do you expect the person?s reaction to the meeting to be ?
    fear/ anger/ anxiety?
-   What will you do if you start to get interest from a third party,
    whether general or threatening?

If possible you should remove batteries from phones before travelling to
the meeting location, so as to avoid remote tracking. (See the Mobile
Phones lesson for more advice on mitigating the risks of phones)

Ideally all parties would conduct counter-surveillance when travelling
to the meeting. See the Counter-Surveillance lesson for advice on how to
do this. If the person you are meeting is not trained in this, and you
are unsure of their security, one of your colleagues may be able to
check whether your contact has been followed. You should ensure you are
clear before you arrive. If possible you should arrive first and check
the area is clear ? check the toilets, emergency exits and likely
approaches.

Try to sit where you can observe the whole location but still have your
back to a wall and be close to/ have a clear path to an escape route. If
you have a second colleague available who is not needed in the meeting,
they can take a seat nearby with a clear view of you and exits.

Do not commit to staying somewhere by buying something until you are
sure you are clear ? You might attract suspicion leaving otherwise.
Agree a subtle and simple signal to alert your colleague if you feel
something is wrong.

It is important to keep control of the flow of the meeting. After
introductions you should begin by mentioning security to the person:
agree on your alternate time and place for the meeting if a problem
occurs; let them know what you can and cannot do to help them if there
is a problem; agree on a discreet signal in case there is a problem.

Avoid ordering meals and pay for what you do get straight away and in
cash ? This avoids your identification and allows you to make a speedy
exit if needed.

Observe people who enter after the person you are meeting, as well as
anyone who sits close to you ? use knowledge of surveillance teams to
assess them. Always trust your instincts ? prepare to leave immediately
if you feel something is not right.

Avoid incriminating yourself. If possible, avoid writing on paper ? you
can always ask for details to be sent via encrypted email later. (See
the Email lesson for advice on how to send encrypted email.) If notes
are necessary, try not to write anything sensitive in the first ten
minutes and in general keep the amount of sensitive notes you
take/actually record to a minimum whenever possible. Consider using
codenames (esp. for testimony or sensitive information). When finished
with your notes, always remember to destroy them safely and dispose of
it in places away from the meeting location. Do not let waitresses or
waiters overhear your conversation.

Unfortunately bugging equipment is very cheap, widespread and effective.
It is very, very hard to find eavesdropping equipment that has been
planted against you ? many look like ordinary electronic items. In some
countries, many high profile hotels are targets for regular bugging due
to the frequent presence of business people, diplomats, NGOs etc.

The best tactic in avoiding such devices is to be unpredictable and
change locations frequently if you are on high-risk travel and need to
avoid surveillance. Be very wary of conducting sensitive activities in
fixed locations (such as the office of a partner or a hotel room) for
too long or repetitively. Limiting the provision of information in
advance (for example, of which rooms will be used for conferences in
specific hotels) is also useful as it reduces the time a hostile
organisation has to plant a device. Outside in the open air can also be
a good place to discuss sensitive matters. Make sure you are not
overlooked.

If dealing with sensitive matters, always assume the room is bugged.
Ensure that all mobile phones are turned off and batteries removed (as
they can be turned on remotely without you knowing and used as a
listening device). If possible you should remove batteries from phone
before arriving at meeting location. (See the Mobile Phones lesson for
more advice on avoiding the risks of phones) Masking noises like a loud
radio or TV can be useful for reducing overheard conversations, although
the most advanced devices can eliminate these extra sounds.

Unplug all unnecessary electronic devices from the electrical sockets.
(If possible, turn off the electricity at the mains and check behind all
electrical plug and light switch sockets.) Pay particular attention to
smoke alarms, lamps, clocks etc. Don?t forget about staff such as
cleaners or waiters who may be able to overhear what is going on.

It is best to get the person you are meeting to leave first ? that way
you can check for any third party reactions to see if they?re clean as
they leave. Wait about ten minutes before you leave. If possible your
colleague (who should still look unconnected to you) should remain
behind for a further ten minutes to check that you are clean.
