Prevention
==========

Human rights workers, journalists and humanitarian staff are sometimes
arrested or detained. The risk of this happening can be significantly
reduced by:

-   Good relations with local authorities and groups where possible
-   Appropriate behaviour, on and off duty
-   Obeying local laws and customs
-   Ensuring that all legal documentation is correct, and carried by all
    staff and vehicles as required
-   Training and briefing staff before they begin their assignments

Be aware of which areas and groups benefit from aid and which do not,
and therefore might feel discriminated against, and make sure that as
many people as possible in the area of operations understand your
organisation and the role it is playing. Transparency, good
communications, integrity, even-handedness and respectful attitudes help
as well.

Organisational Response
=======================

If a staff member is arrested and their whereabouts are unknown, the
first priority is to establish where they are and under whose authority.
Be assertive and visit all relevant local authorities, inform the
embassy (in the case of an international staff member) and be very
persistent and insistent in seeking information.

Remember that a staff member may be arrested for legitimate reasons and
may have to account for their actions. Either way, engage a good local
lawyer, who knows the local languages and the local system, has
experience with this type of situation and perhaps has useful
connections.

When it is clear who has arrested the staff member and where they are,
seek to ensure that their rights are protected. Insist on their right to
be visited and to medical and legal assistance, and request improvements
in the conditions in which they are being kept, if these are not
acceptable. Protest if these requests are not met. It is important to
find out from them exactly what happened.

People are often arrested without formal charges being brought, in which
case insist that a charge is articulated within a specified period of
time. The charge may relate to the individual (for example they are
accused of being involved in a crime) or the organisation (for example
an accusation of spying under cover of humanitarian work). In any
scenario the main priority is to work towards the safe and speedy
release of the staff member. In most circumstances, only once a staff
member is freed from wrongful charges should efforts be made to clear
the name of the individual or the organisation.

Liaise with, and manage, the staff member?s family. Tell them the steps
being taken, maintain a direct regular line of communication, remain
aware of what steps the family intends or has taken, and warn them if
what they plan to do looks like it may be counter-productive.

Inform other humanitarian organisations, such as the ICRC, and ask their
advice, if appropriate. In many cases, the knowledge that other
international organisations are aware of the detention may be enough to
persuade the authorities to release the detainee.

What to do if Arrested
======================

Below are some useful pointers to remember if you are ever arrested. If
travelling, your protocol for conduct during questioning should be
agreed during the planning of the trip.

-   Identify yourself clearly as a representative of your organisation
    where appropriate.
-   The most important consideration is to ensure outside help is aware
    of what is occurring. The Panic Button app can be helpful in letting
    your friends or colleagues know you are in trouble with just the
    press of a button.
-   Prepare yourself mentally for what might be coming. It requires
    patience on your part and the ability to keep calm. You might be
    threatened, assaulted, cuffed, put in a confined space such as a
    cell, mistreated, intimidated, sleep/food/water deprived etc. In
    general highlight these issues immediately to the authorities who
    made the arrest and also your legal support - and make sure they
    are noted.
-   Even in the environments most hostile to the work of HRDs,
    authorities generally still seek to have a confession (even if it is
    false or gotten through force) before they take further action. If
    you remain calm and don?t give this to them, it makes it much harder
    for them to make false allegations against you.
-   Never sign anything you don?t agree with or in a language you
    don?t understand.
-   Know your legal rights and be persistent in requesting that they you
    are granted them. E.g. to see a lawyer, speak to the embassy,
    medical treatment etc.
-   Be co-operative, calm and helpful but don?t volunteer
    information unnecessarily. Think about what information is
    unimportant, such as the general activities of your organisation,
    and what is high-risk, such as the sensitive data you were recently
    passed by a whistle-blower.
-   Attempt to understand at an early point
    -   Who arrested you?
    -   Where are they taking you?
    -   What type of organisation is behind it? (Local police might have
        a very different agenda then a national intelligence agency)
    -   Who else was arrested?
    -   Why were you arrested? What is their agenda?
    -   How much do they actually know?
    -   How long can they keep you?

Questioning Techniques
======================

Questioning techniques to be aware of include:

-   Asking trivial information to get you talking and then shifting to
    more sensitive information when they feel you are co-operative;
-   Threatening, then reducing the threat (known commonly as ?good cop?,
    ?bad cop?);
-   Physical intimidation;
-   Asking you the same questions repeatedly to see if there is any
    inconsistency in what you are saying. You may be asked to give the
    same timeline backwards to look for inconsistencies;
-   Claiming that your co-workers or others have made allegations
    against you or that they have specific evidence against you. Their
    aim is to get you to confirm things they are suspicious about. Don?t
    voluntarily confirm what might just be their suspicions.
