Vehicle-related accidents are the major cause of injuries and fatalities
among aid personnel. Driving in unfamiliar and sometimes difficult
conditions can increase the likelihood of an accident. Other dangers
include ambush, robbery and aggressive behaviour of armed personnel at
checkpoints. If available and practical, all staff members should
receive driver safety training.

The most important piece of security advice an aid worker or human
rights defender can be given is ALWAYS WEAR A SEATBELT.

Driving Guidelines

-   Park in well-lit, heavily populated areas. Close all windows and
    lock doors before leaving the vehicle. Have keys ready in hand when
    returning to vehicle. Check the back seat before entering.
-   Immediately lock doors upon entry. Open windows no more than 5 cm
    and only those windows near occupied seats.
-   Do not speed or drive too fast for conditions. Observe local driving
    laws and regulations.
-   Avoid night driving or driving alone where possible.
-   Avoid letting the fuel tank fall below half full.
-   Keep a spare vehicle key in the office.
-   Never voluntarily carry unauthorized passengers,
    especially soldiers. However, if threatened, provide
    the transportation. In the event of an attempted carjacking, you
    should not risk your life to save a vehicle.

-   In insecure locations, all staff should be met on first arrival, and
    on subsequent arrivals if necessary. Those meeting staff should
    carry identification.
-   Vary the time and route of any regular journeys you make. If
    criminals can predict where you will be and when, it is easier for
    them to target you.
-   In remote areas or where threats may be present along the route,
    select primary and alternate routes.
-   Avoid areas with criminal activity or known threats. If possible
    avoid ?choke points? such as narrow alleys.
-   When possible, consult with other agencies and organizations to
    monitor route conditions and change routes as necessary.
-   Notify others of travel times, destination, and steps they should
    take if you are late.
-   Mark official vehicles appropriately for the area.
-   Consider posting a decal on your door or window indicating guns are
    not permitted in the vehicle.
-   Avoid transporting sensitive documents or equipment in areas prone
    to banditry. Arrange proper permits for transporting items that
    could be interpreted as useful to combatants or terrorists.
-   Know how to perform basic vehicle maintenance (changing a flat tire,
    checking and adding fluids, etc.)

Important issues to take into consideration when planning a journey
include:

-   Recent incidents on the route. \*Check the Dashboard for information
    about your area\*
-   Weather
-   Length of journey ? time of departure/ arrival?
-   Should you travel in convoy with another vehicle?
-   Communications schedule
-   Checkpoints en route ? what is the process for passing through? (See
    Checkpoints lesson for advice on this)
-   Other dangerous points en route (does the route pass through an area
    controlled by military, a warlord or local leader). Has negotiation
    been carried out and permissions obtained and understood prior to
    leaving? Crossings of conflict lines and through insecure areas
    should be rigorously checked before travelling.
-   Safe ?waypoints? en route
-   Refuelling stops
-   Sustenance/ food stops
-   What is your plan in the event of a car accident or breakdown?

Drivers should:

-   Be given a clear briefing about safe driving procedures before
    departure
-   Consider the length of journey ? do you need more than one driver?
-   Factor in prayer or sustenance stops if necessary
-   Consider the driver?s ethnicity if going into dangerous areas

Considerations in choosing type of vehicle should include:

-   Urban or rural trip? State of the roads? 4x4 necessary?
-   Desirability of vehicle for car-jacking
-   High profile or low profile

Road worthiness checks carried out before using a vehicle should
include:

-   Tyres
-   Seatbelts
-   Fuel
-   Brakes
-   Oil level
-   Steering
-   Loading

The following items (location dependant) should be kept in the vehicle
at all times.

Equipment:

-   Communication equipment and key telephone numbers
-   Additional fuel & oil
-   Water
-   Maps
-   GPS
-   Spare parts for car
-   Spare wheel (x2) and jack
-   Basic tools
-   Fluorescent warning triangle
-   Tow rope
-   First aid kit
-   Torch

Documents:

-   Permission to travel, if required
-   Visas
-   Car documents
-   Driver?s licence & insurance
-   Personal ID
-   Organisational ID if possible
-   Medical vaccination certificates

General items:

-   Food
-   Water
-   Cold/ hot weather clothing
-   Blankets/ shade structure

Traffic accidents can be minimized by implementing defensive driver
training and other precautions, but they can never be avoided entirely.
When an accident is mishandled, it can quickly change from an
unfortunate occurrence into a security risk. In extreme situations, it
can trigger violence or threats of retribution.

The following procedures are useful when involved in an accident.

-   Quickly discern the attitudes and actions of people around the
    accident site to ensure that you are not at risk by staying.
-   Do not leave the site unless your safety is jeopardized and then
    only to drive to the nearest police or military post.
-   Make site safe and visible to other traffic.
-   Provide care and assistance as appropriate.
-   As appropriate, contact local authorities immediately and cooperate
    as required.
-   Contact the your office as soon as practical.
-   If feasible, take pictures of the scene and record the names and
    contact information of witnesses, responding authorities, and
    those involved.
-   When approaching an accident involving other vehicles consider
    safety and security, taking care not to become involved in a second
    accident while responding.

Vehicle accidents are the main cause of injury and fatality among NGO
staff. Avoiding excessive speed, following applicable traffic laws, and
wearing seat belts minimize the chances of injury.

Offices should implement a transportation policy that ensures vehicles
are maintained in a state of operational readiness; journeys are
planned; and vehicle users are prepared to respond to a range of
possible incidents. An accident report format should be placed in the
logbook of each vehicle.
