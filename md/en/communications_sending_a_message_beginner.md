Regular SMS Text messages
=========================

SMS messages are not well encrypted so you should not rely on them to
transmit sensitive information securely. Sent SMS messages can be
intercepted and kept by your service operator or by third parties with
inexpensive equipment. Those messages will carry the phone numbers of
the sender and recipient as well as the content of the message. What's
more, SMS messages can easily be altered or forged by third parties.

If you do need to use SMS for something, consider establishing a code
system between you and your recipients. Codes may make your
communication more secure and may provide an additional way of
confirming the identity of the person you're communicating with. Code
systems need to be secure and change frequently.

Saved messages on your phone can easily be accessed by anybody who gets
hold of your phone so consider deleting all received and sent messages
straightaway.

*Regular SMS text messages to or from your mobile phone are not secure.*

Sending secure SMS on your phone
================================

SMSSecure
---------

SMSSecure is a free, open-source tool for sending and receiving secure
SMS text messages on Android phones. It works both for encrypted and
non-encrypted SMS, so you can use it as your default SMS application. It
automatically imports all your contacts and existing SMS, so only takes
a few seconds to set up. No internet connection is required to send or
receive SMS. To exchange encrypted SMS this tool has to be installed by
both the sender and the recipient of a message, so you will need to get
people you communicate with regularly to use it as well. SMSSecure also
encrypts all SMS locally, so if your phone is lost or stolen, your
messages are protected.

Many people who previously used TextSecure for secure SMS now use
SMSSecure.

You can find SMSSecure on google play and installation takes only a few
clicks.

Sending secure online messages on your phone
============================================

Signal
------

[Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
is a free, simple open-source tool for sending end-to-end encrypted
messages and also for having secure calls. It works for both Androids
and iPhones and replaces the previous android app called TextSecure.
(Users with TextSecure or the old Signal will have already received the
update, or can do it manually be visiting the Playstore/Appstore and
pressing Update)

Signal now also incorporates secure voice calling app, Redphone ?
meaning there is one simple app you can use for both secure calling and
messaging, whether on Android or iPhone, as long as the person you are
communicating with has Signal too.

Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no
separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose. It
uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name) ? this
makes it easier for the user, though it also makes it easier to analyze
the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. Signal uses a central
server, which is a point of centralization and thus puts it in the
powerful position of having control over some of this data. However they
cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, so no one else can
either.

Telegram
--------

A note on Telegram: While Telegram does use end-to-end encryption in
some modes, there have been serious concerns with the quality of their
encryption and the amount of information it gathers on users, including
their full contact lists. Users must also remember to start a new
?Secret Chat?, before encryption is activated. Given these concerns we
cannot recommend Telegram as a secure method of communicating.

ChatSecure
----------

[ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org/) as a secure text chat application
that works for both iPhones and Androids and across a number of
platforms. Not only does ChatSecure encrypt your phone to phone
messages, it can also operate across a number of platforms, and offers
more functions than Signal. ChatSecure offers easy and strong encryption
for your chats that provides both authenticity (you can verify that you
are chatting with the right person) and the independent security of each
session so that even if the encryption of one chat session is
compromised, other past and future sessions will remain secure.

See how to set it up in the [ChatSecure tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/chatsecure).

WhatsApp
========

WhatsApp is the most popular mobile communication tool in the world,
offering free messaging to individuals and groups and operating on all
phone types. Until November 2014, using WhatsApp was considered highly
insecure and was not recommend for anyone who required any level of
security in their communications. It now offers strong encryption for
some messages on some phones.

Since November 2014, WhatsApp has integrated the secure code of a
well-respected privacy and technology company (Open Whisper Systems)
into its product. This means that its messages now have a very strong
level of verifiable security, and WhatsApp can no longer easily view or
be forced to handover messages to authorities.

However it is very important to note:

-   This only currently applies to users using WhatsApp on Android
    phones (users on Apple iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Nokia will
    be only get the same protection at some point in the future.)
-   Only for messages from one individual to another individual (ie: not
    for group chats)
-   Does not encrypt any pictures sent once they arrive on the phone
-   While WhatsApp or others cannot view the content of your messages,
    they can still know that you are communication with someone
    (e.g metadata). In some cases, this may still have negative
    security consequences.

For these reasons we still recommend that you use
[Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
for secure messaging and calls.

Secure messaging on your computer
=================================

Pidgin
------

Instead of using Skype, Google Talk or MSN Messenger to send messages on
your computer we recommend you use the secure, free, open-source tool,
Pidgin, instead.

Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple
chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with
friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a
Yahoo chat room all at the same time. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and
other UNIX operating systems.

Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file
transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications.

Adium
-----

A good alternative to Pidgin that works with OS X on Macs is
[Adium](http://adium.im/).
