Protecting Yourself on Social Networks
======================================

Social networking sites are some of the most popular websites and tools
we use on the Internet. Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have hundreds of
millions of users each. With social networking platforms come many
benefits, such as the unprecedented opportunity to communicate, publish,
coordinate, and persuade. Many people use it for their professional as
well personal lives. But, this also means that we're sharing a lot about
ourselves online, usually more than we realise. In some cases, this can
put our operations, our contacts, or us at risk.

When using social networks it is important to consider:

-   -   What information do I want keep private and who do I want to
    keep it private from?

Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself
against the social media site itself, against other users of the site,
or both.

Take care registering
=====================

-   Consider whether you want to use your real name or not. Might you
    want to share things that could be dangerous if they were linked to
    you?
-   When you register, don't provide more information than is necessary.
    Do you really need to include your birthday/contact
    number/employment details?
-   If you are concerned with hiding your identity, use a separate
    email address. Be aware that your IP address may be logged at
    registration, so for full, guaranteed anonymity you may want to use
    a VPN or even Tor.
-   Consider using separate accounts/identities, or maybe different
    pseudonyms, for different campaigns and activities.
-   Choose a strong password, change it regularly and, if possible,
    enable two-factor authentication.
-   Beware of password recovery/security questions whose answers can be
    mined from your social media details. For example: ?What city were
    you born in?? or ?What is the name of your pet?? You may want to
    choose password recovery answers that are false. One good way to
    remember the answers to password recovery questions, should you
    choose to use false answers for added security, is to note your
    chosen answers in a password safe. See the [Password
    lesson](umbrella://lesson/passwords) for more information on how to
    choose and remember strong passwords.
-   Only connect to people you know personally and trust.

Check the Site's Privacy Policy
===============================

Remember that information you post on most social media sites does not
belong you ? it is subject to the sites own policies and they can use it
or share it with others. We know that reading privacy policies is a
near-impossible task, but you may want to take a look at sections on how
your data is used, when it is shared with other parties, and how the
service responds to law enforcement requests.

![](socialb2.png)

Social networking sites often collect sensitive information beyond what
you actually post?where you are, what interests and advertisements you
react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through "Like" buttons).
Be aware of what you like and repost if they may put you at risk. It can
be helpful to block third-party cookies and use tracker-blocking browser
extensions to make sure such information isn't being passively
transmitted to third parties.

Some social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, have business
relationships with data brokers in order to target advertisements more
effectively. You can see guides that walk you through how to opt-out of
these tracking schemes here:\

relationships](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/how-opt-out-twitters-tailored-advertisements-and-more)

Change Your Privacy Settings
============================

Specifically, change the default settings. For example:

-   Do you want to share your posts with the public, or only with a
    specific group of people?
-   Should people be able to find you using your email address or phone
    number?
-   Do you want your location shared automatically?
-   See here for: [How to change your Facebook privacy
    settings](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/how-protect-your-privacy-facebooks-graph-search)

Remember, privacy settings are subject to change. Be sure to pay
attention to these changes closely to see if any information that was
once private will be shared, or if any additional settings will allow
you to take more control of your privacy.

Think about what you share
==========================

Always ask the questions:

-   Who can access the information I am putting online?
-   Who controls and owns the information I put into a social networking
    site?
-   What information about me are my contacts passing on to other
    people?
-   Will my contacts mind if I share information about them with other
    people?
-   Do I trust everyone with whom I'm connected?

Be careful about putting too much information into your status updates ?
even if you trust the people in your networks. It is easy for someone to
copy your information or unintentionally share something.

It's easy to share a link to a website and get your friend's attention.
But who else will be paying attention, and what kind of reaction will
they have?

Sharing videos/photos
=====================

Photos and videos can reveal people's identities very easily. It's
important that you have the consent of the subject/s of any photo or
video that you post. If you are posting an image of someone else, be
aware of how you may be compromising their privacy. Never post a video
or photo of anyone without getting their consent first. As a good rule
of thumb, don't post information, images, or updates about people you
know if they aren't posting about themselves.

Photos and videos can also reveal a lot of information unintentionally.
Many cameras will embed hidden data (metadata tags), that reveal the
date, time and location of the photo, camera type, etc. Photo and video
sharing sites may publish this information when you upload content to
their sites.

[Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) has created
an open-source app called [ObscuraCam](umbrella://lesson/obscuracam) to
detect/select faces on photos and blur them. Obscuracam also deletes the
original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured
media, it provides an easy way to upload it.

Check what your friends share about you
=======================================

Remember that you?re not the only person who can give away potentially
sensitive data about yourself. Your friends can tag you in photos,
report your location, and make their connections to you public in a
variety of ways. You may have the option of untagging yourself from
these posts, but privacy does not work retroactively. You may want to
talk to your friends about what you do and do not feel comfortable
having them share about you in public.

Think about what you join
=========================

What information are you giving to people if you join a group or
community? What does it say about you? Alternatively, what are people
announcing to the world if they join a group or community that you have
created? How are you putting people at risk?

Also if you join a group with a large number of members that you don't
know, then this can compromise any privacy or security settings that you
have applied to your account, so think about what information you are
giving away before joining. Are you using your photo and real name so
strangers can identify you?

Don?t use social media sites for instant chats
==============================================

Many social networking sites have tools that allow you to have
discussions with your friends in real time. These operate like Instant
Messaging and are one of the most insecure ways to communicate on the
internet, both because they may reveal who you are communicating with,
and what you are communicating about.

Never engage in chats with people you don?t know, especially those who
want to send you documents or pictures. This is a method commonly used
by authorities to put malware in activists? computers.

![](socialb4.png)

You should use a specific application for your chats, such as Pidgin
with an Off-the-record plugin, which uses encryption. Read the [Sending
a Message lesson](umbrella://lesson/sending-a-message) or [Pidgin tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/pidgin) to find out how.

Don?t rely on social media for storage
--------------------------------------

Be cautious about how safe your content is on a social networking
site. Never rely on a social networking site as a primary host for your
content or information. It is very easy for governments to block access
to a social networking site within their boundaries if they suddenly
find its content objectionable.

Access sites securely
=====================

Access social networking sites using https:// to safeguard your
username, password and other information you post. Using https:// rather
than http:// adds another layer of security by encrypting the traffic
from your browser to your social networking site.

Be careful when accessing your social network account in public internet
spaces. Delete your password and browsing history when using a browser
on a public machine.
