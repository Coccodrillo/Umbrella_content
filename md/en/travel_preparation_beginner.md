-   Ask some strategic questions before your trip
    -   What is the objective of the trip? (ensure clear Terms
        of Reference)
    -   What profile are you/your org org taking? High profile/ low
        profile? Why?
    -   What is the threshold of acceptable risk your organisation is
        willing to take?
    -   What about the risk to partners who you are meeting with?
    -   What damage could this trip cause potential adversaries? How
        interested will potential adversaries be in this trip?
-   Complete a risk assessment
-   Discuss trip with regional security focal point to confirm whether
    trip falls within threshold of acceptable risk
-   Where possible, organise post-arrival context/ security briefings
    from partners

-   Traveller to ensure they understand how to operate
    communications equipment.
-   Buy ?burner? sim-card before travel (WorldSim or Libara for example)
    and disposable phone. Make sure the SIM has funds on it. Often this
    is better than buying a local sim-card because that often requires
    registering the sim-card with your passport
-   Check phone will function in the country travelled to
-   Bring a satellite phone if necessary (e.g. if phone lines are poor
    or possibility of censorship during high tensions) ? check they are
    legal in the country you are going to
-   Programme essential numbers into your phone, but not
    sensitive numbers. Put sensitive numbers into the ?notes? section of
    your phone but need to disguise them effectively.
-   Additionally, ensure you have key numbers ? such as embassies -
    stored remotely or written elsewhere (coded where necessary).
-   Note 112/911/999 Emergency number

-   Ensure passport is valid for at least 6 months with appropriate
    visas and travel documents. When appropriate, photocopy passport and
    other documents and carry only the copy, keeping a second copy at
    home or office. Send a copy of your passport to your email address.
    Securely email other key information to yourself to ensure it is
    available if needed.
-   Familiarise yourself with your organisation?s relevant
    security procedures.
-   Check insurance is valid.
-   Consider getting an identity card from your organisation. This could
    be a laminated, two-sided photo identification card with English or
    another UN standard language on one side and the local official
    language on the reverse.
-   Ensure key information is shared with the right people before
    leaving ? Human Resources? Your family? Your manager? The person
    responsible for managing the trip?

-   Discuss Standard Operating Procedures prior to departure
-   You should carry your ?constant companion? on your person at
    all times. A constant companion includes some cash, your key
    documentation needed for evacuation, and a list of emergency names,
    addresses, phone numbers, and the names of reputable hotels along
    the route.
-   Only minimal data should be brought with you ? it should be backed
    up and, if appropriate, encrypted.
-   If carrying sensitive information decide how to discreetly carry it
    in to the country. What?s your story? Prepare to answer questions at
    airports and elsewhere. (For advice on both of these, see the
    Borders lesson)
-   If any sensitive meetings are to be held, or meetings with
    vulnerable human rights defenders, follow the advice laid out in the
    Meeting lesson.
-   Have an alternative plan to exit the country. Do you have a
    ?stand-by? visa for a neighbouring country?
-   If driving or being driven in a vehicle, follow the advice laid out
    in the Vehicles lesson.
-   You should understand tools, systems and techniques for good
    personal security management, counter-surveillance, safe use of
    email etc. (training might be necessary) This may include making
    yourself familiar with the advice in the Arrest and
    Kidnapping lessons.
-   Inform authorities and embassies of the trip,
-   Will a curfew be respected? Will solo movement be allowed?

-   You should carry a medical emergency card. Pre-check the best
    hospital in the area you will be visiting and also have a medical
    plan B.
-   Make sure you obtain correct health advice, vaccinations and
    malaria prophylaxis.
-   Check that any essential medicines required are carried.
-   Inform your organisation and your travel companions if you have
    heath complaints that could become serious (e.g. Asthma,
    diabetes etc.) and how they should respond in an emergency.

-   Ensure adequate cash or other payment tools for the trip.
-   Take key items of equipment
    -   Travel lock
    -   Computer lock
    -   Door wedge
    -   Tamper-proof scotch tape
    -   Mobile Wi-Fi device
    -   Solar charger
    -   Cheap notebook from which you can rip out pages unnoticed
    -   Mosquito net/ repellent etc.
-   Ensure any digital equipment you take with you ? phone, computer ?
    is wiped ?clean?. For more advice on how to do this see the
    Protecting Files lesson.

-   Discuss who needs to have advance knowledge of your trip ?
    minimising the number of people who know about your presence is a
    good way to increase your security. This needs to be balanced with
    operational practicalities and the ability to complete
    the assignment.
-   Limit who has information (need to know) on
    -   Trip plans
    -   Movements, patterns, lifestyle
    -   Travel modes, itineraries, professional arrangements
    -   Security arrangements & procedures
    -   Your organisation?s duties, associates and colleague
-   For more advice, see the Managing Information lesson.
