If travelling, you should first follow the advice outlined in the
Preparation lesson.

This lesson focuses specifically on how to cross borders if travelling
for sensitive work or with sensitive information. In establishing the
potential risk and risk mitigation measures for crossing borders, it is
important to establish a few basics about the reasons for, and possible
sensitivities of, your trip. It is vital to be aware of the nature of
the information you will be carrying into and out of the country, and
how you will carry it.

Sensitive or revealing information you may carry could include:

-   Data on people at risk/HRDs you are meeting
-   Travel plansPasswords/ access codes
-   Censored/ banned information
-   Organisation sensitive information
-   Personal information
-   Embarrassing/ incriminating information
-   Legal - encryption or data not allowed for export
-   Receipts
-   Reports

This information may be stored in/on notebooks, publications, laptops,
phones, USBs, CDs, or SD cards.

Remember:

-   Only minimal data should be brought with you
-   Bring a ?clean? laptop and phone if possible
-   Carry sensitive information and electronic equipment in hand
    luggage, as at least you know If it has been tampered with
-   Small, encrypted USB sticks or Micro SD cards can be useful for
    security and being able to hide sensitive data if necessary. See the
    Protecting Files lesson for advice on how to encrypt files.
-   Bring a cheap notebook in which you can rip out the pages unnoticed
-   Tamper proof Scotch tape can be useful for enhancing the security of
    your equipment, hotel safe, laptop ports etc.
-   Check pockets, wallet, bags everything before travel
-   Prepare your story (More in next section)

-   Agree in advance with colleagues what you will say. Discuss any red
    lines you will not cross (e.g. giving information about high risk
    activists who you intend on meeting)
-   In some environments, it is best not to attract attention by
    travelling in a group, so sit separately and approach
    immigration separately. (Although bare in mind that authorities
    often know if big organisations are coming to the country anyway.)
-   Say/do nothing sensitive on plane ? many human rights defenders have
    been arrested because they were overheard speaking about
    their activities.
-   Provide only minimal information to immigration about activities.
-   It may not be within the remit of your organisation to lie but
    neither should you volunteer information unnecessarily.
-   Be prepared to be questioned about your activities in other
    countries/visas marked in your passport.
-   Be polite but firm with authorities.
-   Decide in advance if you are going to put the actual hotel and
    location where you are staying on the visa entry form. (Consider
    risk vs. benefit)
-   Do not get separated from your belongings, especially
    electronic items. If they are taken away from you, you should assume
    that they have been compromised.
-   Keep phones off until well outside airport. Airports are common
    areas for tracking and viruses.
-   Keep Wi-Fi off if not vital ? do not connect to airport Wi-Fi.
-   Agree in advance with colleagues a location in the building where
    you will meet after immigration and a set time to turn on mobile
    phones if you have not met at this point and need to communicate.

-   If using a paper notebook, try to minimise any potential data loss
    by making up short codes that only you understand. For example, if
    you are meeting a high-risk activist, give them a different name and
    refer to them as that in your notes. Don?t mix sensitive information
    with easily identifiable information.
-   Don?t forget about receipts, tickets, bills etc. They can link
    sensitive activists to your work if not carefully protected.
-   Keep sensitive information in another place (e.g. interview notes in
    a notebook but sensitive names and locations securely emailed
    to yourself.)
-   Type up or take photos of your most sensitive written notes as soon
    as possible and securely email them to yourself and/or keep them on
    an encrypted drive. (See the Protecting Files lesson for advice on
    how to encrypt files.)
-   Avoid taking paper reports or other information from the
    organisations and people that you work with - if your bags are
    searched they will link you. Instead, ask them to give or email you
    digital copies if possible.
-   Dispose of sensitive paper waste immediately. Avoid doing this in
    locations like hotel rooms or offices where it might be taken by
    cleaners or security staff. If necessary, soak paper in water to
    ensure it is unreadable.
-   Minimise the amount of security related information you give to
    people that you meet. At meetings and during other interactions,
    avoid giving details of future operational and travel plans.
-   Travel by different routes at different times if possible in
    high-risk areas.
-   Avoid walking alone/at night if possible.
-   Advise hotel staff not to provide information on your activities;
    although be aware they could be monitoring you, too.
-   Try to memorize emergency phone numbers.
-   Agree a simple discreet signal with any colleagues that can alert
    them to nearby danger. It should be something easy to do but not
    something that would happen accidentally.
-   Always wear seatbelts!

-   You should assume that you might be stopped and searched. Assume
    that anything you have written will be copied or read and
    prepare accordingly.
-   Make sure all sensitive notes are typed up/ photographed and
    then encrypted. (See the Protecting Files lesson for advice on how
    to encrypt files.)
-   To prepare for the long-term confiscation of your equipment at an
    exit port, you should backup key files remotely, such as to your
    secure email.
-   Before departure, make sure to remove any sensitive paper waste from
    your room and dispose of it safely elsewhere. If necessary, soak
    paper in water to ensure it is unreadable.
-   At a suitable time, speak with your colleagues (if travelling
    with them) about what you will say if stopped and questioned when
    leaving the country. It might be the case that certain parts of the
    trip (such as meeting with a high-risk activist) you do not want to
    mention to the authorities. Any plan of what you agree to say should
    be:
    -   Simple;
    -   Easily repeatable;
    -   Verifiable.
-   When leaving the country, the same principles as entering apply.
    Keep electronics and sensitive material on you at all times. If
    necessary, hide a small USB or micro SD card somewhere it is harder
    to find.
