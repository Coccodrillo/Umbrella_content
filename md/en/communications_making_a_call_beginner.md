Regular phone calls
===================

When you make a call from a landline or a mobile phone, your call is not
end-to-end encrypted. If you're using a mobile phone, your call may be
weakly encrypted between your handset and the cell phone towers. However
as your conversation travels through the phone network, it's vulnerable
to interception by your phone company and, by extension, any governments
or organizations that have power over your phone company. There are also
inexpensive techniques which other people can use to listen to your
calls if they are close to your phone.

VoIP Calls
==========

The easiest way to ensure you have good encryption on voice
conversations is to use VoIP instead of regular calls. VoIP (Voice over
Internet Protocol) refers to calls made using the internet. Using VoIP
is generally free (or significantly cheaper than mobile phone calls) and
leaves few data traces. Good call encryption software is currently only
supported on a few models of smart phones.

In order to have end-to-end encrypted VoIP conversations, both parties
must be using the same (or compatible) software. Conversations between
providers such as Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either,
since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where
encryption is NOT in place.

Making secure calls on your phone
=================================

Signal
------

Signal is a free, simple open-source tool for having end-to-end
encrypted phone calls and also for sending secure messages. It works for
both Androids and iPhones and replaces the previous android app called
Redphone. (Users with RedPhone installed will be prompted to install
Signal instead. If you already have Signal installed, you can just
uninstall RedPhone. It will no longer be maintained as an independent
app.)

Signal now also incorporates secure messaging app, Textsecure ? meaning
there is one simple app you can use for both secure calling and
messaging, whether on Android or iPhone, as long as the person you are
communicating with has Signal too.

Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no
separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose. It
uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name) ? this
makes it easier for the user, though it also makes it easier to analyze
the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. Signal uses a central
server, which is a point of centralization and thus puts it in the
powerful position of having control over some of this data. However they
cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, so no one else can
either.

Ostel
-----

Another notable tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls is
OStel. It works on every smartphone (Blackberry, iPhone, Nokia, Android)
and every desktop (Mac, PC, Linux, etc). It is one of the most secure
means to communicate via voice and comes with many easy set-up wizards
for different VoIP services, available [here](https://ostel.co/). (The
accompanying app for Android phones is CSipSimple.) Both you and the
person you want to talk to will need an ostel account. It securely
encrypts all your speech and makes it very difficult to trace your data
and find out who you are talking to. If you download CSipSimple from
ostel.co it also comes preconfigured for use with ostel, which makes it
very easy to install and use.

Redphone
--------

[RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone)
is a free and open-source tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone
calls that works only on Android phones. It is easy to install and very
easy to use, since it integrates itself into your normal dialing and
contacts system. People you want to talk to also need to install and use
RedPhone (or, if they have iPhones, Signal, as noted below). For ease of
use RedPhone uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user
name on other VoIP services). However it also becomes easier to analyze
the traffic it produces and trace it back to you, through your mobile
number. RedPhone uses a central server, which is a point of
centralization and this puts RedPhone in a powerful position (of having
control over some of this data).\
You can learn how to set it up simply in the RedPhone tool guide.

Signal is the version of RedPhone that works on iPhones. The two systems
are fully compatible and can be used to communicate securely with one
another. Learn how to set it up in the Signal tool guide.

Making secure calls on your computer
====================================

JitsiMeet
---------

When using voice communication to exchange sensitive information it is
important to choose a tool that encrypts the call all the way from your
computer to the recipient's computer. We would recommend that you use
the free and open-source tool, JitsiMeet as your choice for VoIP. It
provides a free, easy to use, open source, more secure alternative to
Skype and can be used for video and voice and for group video chat.
There is no requirement for you or the person you?re communicating with
to sign-up. You just visit <https://meet.jit.si> enter a meeting name,
(make sure it has no spaces and is difficult to guess), and share the
link with whoever you want to speak with. Simple as that.

Skype
-----

Beware! Most popular VoIP providers, such as Skype and Google Hangouts,
offer transport encryption so that eavesdroppers cannot listen in, but
the providers themselves are still potentially able to listen in.
Depending on your threat model, this may or may not be a problem, but we
would recommend that you avoid Skype if you discuss sensitive
information. It is important to keep in mind that Skype is owned by
Microsoft, which has a commercial interest in knowing when you use Skype
and from where. Skype also may allow law enforcement agencies access to
all your communications history.

While we can't recommend Skype as a secure communication tool, it is
very important to take some precautions if you still decide to use Skype
as a tool for sensitive communication:

-   Download and install Skype only from its official website
    [www.skype.com](http://skype.com/) to avoid a Skype program infected
    with spyware.
-   Change your Skype password regularly.
-   Set the privacy settings on Skype so that it does not keep a history
    of chats.
-   Disable the Skype setting which automatically accepts incoming
    files, as this has occasionally been used to introduce
    malware/spyware onto computers.
-   Always independently verify the identity of the person with whom you
    are communicating. It is easier to do this when voice chatting,
    especially if you know the person you want to talk to.
-   Decide if your Skype username should identify your or have any
    relationship to your real name, or the name of you organisation.\
    ? Be careful of what you say - develop a code system to discuss
    sensitive topics without using specific terminology.
