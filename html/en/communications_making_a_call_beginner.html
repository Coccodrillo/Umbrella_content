<h1 id="regular-phone-calls">Regular phone calls</h1>
<p>When you make a call from a landline or a mobile phone, your call is not end-to-end encrypted. If you're using a mobile phone, your call may be weakly encrypted between your handset and the cell phone towers. However as your conversation travels through the phone network, it's vulnerable to interception by your phone company and, by extension, any governments or organizations that have power over your phone company. There are also inexpensive techniques which other people can use to listen to your calls if they are close to your phone.</p>
