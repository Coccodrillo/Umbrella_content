<p>Radios are an insecure method of communication and should not be used for senstive communication if at all possible. If possible, use alternative options as outlined in the <a href="umbrella://lesson/making-a-call">Making a Call lesson</a>. However many in the humanitarian field still need to use them sometimes. If necessary, develop a system of code words between those communicating so that your message will not be so easily understood.</p>
